This is WeGoJim, a personal gym tracking app!



The idea for the app was inspired by my own habit of going to the gym. I realized that it was difficult to remember what weights I used and how many reps I did for each set. The basic idea of this app is to help gym-goers keep track of their workouts instead of having to try and take notes or remember on their own. 

The app is split up into 3 basic pages controlled by a bottom navigation bar.
